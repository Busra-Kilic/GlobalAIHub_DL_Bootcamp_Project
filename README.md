### Image Classificatin with ANN 

This project aims to classify 9 different seafood species using images collected from a supermarket in Izmir. The dataset was collected as part of a university-industry partnership project between Izmir University of Economics and an industrial organization and published in ASYU in 2020. Although Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is commonly used for fish species classification, only Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used in this project.
